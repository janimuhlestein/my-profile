# My_Profile
The profile of my projects, information, and links

1. Header with image and navigation links. Header is sticky.
2. Hero with matching background image.
3. Hero has an image, and a basic statement.
4. About me section.
5. My projects section, with an iframe to Run Buddy, and five stubs with fadeouts.
6. My links section, with links to email, github and linkedin.
7. Footer, with copyright, name, and a backgound image.
8. Responsiveness for different screen sizes--in case flex isn't enough.
